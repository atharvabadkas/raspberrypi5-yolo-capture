# Real-Time Object Detection and Image Capture on Raspberry Pi 5

This project implements a **real-time object image capture system** using **Raspberry Pi 5**, **YOLOv8**, and **OpenCV**. The system detects specific objects (e.g., trays, plates, hands) from a live video feed and captures the best quality frame based on multiple image quality metrics like blur, lighting, motion stability, and detection confidence.

## üì∏ Frame Evaluation Strategy

Each incoming frame is scored on:

1. **Detection Confidence**: From YOLO output
2. **Image Sharpness**: Variance of Laplacian
3. **Motion Stability**: Mean frame difference with previous frame
4. **Lighting Quality**: Histogram entropy & brightness
5. **(Optional)**: BRISQUE/NIQE for holistic quality scoring

Only frames that meet all thresholds are stored.

---

## üìÇ Image Capture Pipeline

1. Capture frames from camera
2. Run YOLO inference
3. If detected class confidence > threshold:
   - Check if motion is minimal
   - Check blur score > clarity threshold
   - Check lighting score in range
4. Store frame in buffer for N frames
5. Pick best frame (highest weighted score)
6. Save to disk with filename: `{timestamp}_{class}_{confidence}.jpg`

---

## üîÅ Performance Optimization

- Process every nth frame (to sustain FPS)
- Parallelize metric calculation and detection
- Use BRISQUE sparingly (optional, heavier)
- Skip saving near-duplicate frames using object tracking heuristics

---

## üí° Real-Time Design Tips

- Use short exposure time (to reduce motion blur)
- Ensure strong lighting (avoid noise/blur)
- Limit image resolution (640x640 or 720p) for faster inference

# Optimizing Real-Time Frame Selection for Clear Waste Item Images

Capturing a clear, non-blurry image of a moving waste item on a Raspberry Pi 5 is challenging due to motion and limited processing power. The system operates on a 15‚Äì30 FPS video feed, and the current approach scores each frame by four metrics‚Äîdetection confidence, frame stability, image clarity, and lighting‚Äîto decide if the frame is worth saving. In this report, we evaluate how effective these metrics are, suggest improvements and additional quality metrics, and propose a real-time decision pipeline for selecting the best frame. We also discuss the trade-offs between accuracy and computational feasibility on the Raspberry Pi 5, concluding with comparison tables for different metrics.

## Current Frame Quality Metrics and Enhancements

### 1. Detection Confidence Score
- Detection confidence comes from YOLO‚Äôs output.
- Higher score = higher certainty about object visibility.
- However, confidence ‚â† clarity.

**Enhancements:**
- Use consecutive detections (ensure stability over time).
- Consider bounding box size.
- Apply class-specific thresholds (e.g., detect at 50%, save at 80%).

---

### 2. Frame Stability Score
- Estimated using mean absolute difference between consecutive frames.
- Low difference = high stability (less motion blur).

**Enhancements:**
- ROI-based stability (focus only on object area).
- Optical Flow (Lucas-Kanade or block matching).
- Temporal smoothing via a sliding window.

---

### 3. Image Clarity (Sharpness) Score
- Measured using **variance of Laplacian**.
- High variance = sharper image.

**Enhancements:**
- Adaptive thresholding.
- Multi-scale Laplacian.
- Explore Sobel, Tenengrad, Brenner gradient.

---

### 4. Lighting Score
- Combines brightness and histogram entropy.
- Helps avoid over/underexposed frames.

**Enhancements:**
- Highlight/shadow checks.
- White balance if color matters.
- Adaptive exposure threshold based on environment.

---

### Effectiveness Summary
- Each metric complements others.
- Use a **composite score** like:  
  `Quality = w_conf*Conf + w_blur*BlurScore ‚Äì w_motion*MotionBlur + w_light*LightScore`

---

## Additional Frame Quality Metrics for Real-Time Assessment

### SSIM (Structural Similarity Index)
- Full-reference metric; compares to a previous ‚Äúgood‚Äù frame.
- High correlation with structure; not ideal without reference.

---

### BRISQUE (No-Reference)
- Measures perceptual quality (lower = better).
- Efficient and suitable for embedded devices.

---

### NIQE (No-Reference, Opinion-Unaware)
- Doesn‚Äôt need training data.
- May not align with human perception as well as BRISQUE.

---

### PIQE (No-Reference)
- Works block-wise and outputs local distortions.
- Slower than BRISQUE/NIQE.

---

### Other Heuristics
- Contrast & Noise metrics (e.g., SNR).
- Edge/Texture density (e.g., Canny edge count).
- Deep learning-based (e.g., NIMA) ‚Äì **too heavy** for Pi.
- Multi-frame similarity comparison.

---

## Real-Time Decision-Making Pipeline for Frame Selection

1. **Continuous Frame Acquisition & Detection**
   - YOLO runs per frame (~10‚Äì15 FPS on Pi 5).
   - Discard frames without detection.

2. **Triggering Frame Evaluation Window**
   - Begin buffering frames once object is detected.

3. **Maintain Frame Buffer with Scores**
   - Buffer N frames (~5‚Äì10).
   - Compute: Confidence, Stability, Blur, Lighting, BRISQUE (optional).

4. **Select Best Frame**
   - Pick highest composite score from buffer.
   - Update in real-time.

5. **Detect Event End**
   - No detections for M frames = event over.
   - Alternatively, use fixed duration (~2 seconds).

6. **Save & Reset**
   - Save best frame.
   - Clear buffer and return to idle mode.

---

### Real-Time Optimizations
- Use multi-threading for metric computation.
- Only evaluate expensive metrics (e.g., BRISQUE) occasionally.
- Discard stale frames if detection is slower than video feed.

---

## Accuracy vs. Computational Feasibility on Raspberry Pi 5

### Detection Cost
- YOLOv8n or YOLOv5n suitable (~50‚Äì100 ms per frame).
- Quantization and input downscaling help.

### Metric Cost
- Fast: Laplacian, entropy, frame diff.
- Moderate: BRISQUE, NIQE (~20‚Äì30 ms).
- Slow: PIQE, NIMA, SSIM.

### Memory/Storage
- Buffering 10 x 720p RGB frames ‚âà 27.6 MB.
- Pi 5 handles this easily.

### Parallelism
- Utilize 4 cores via `multiprocessing`.
- Separate detection, metrics, saving threads.

### Accuracy Trade-offs
- Conservative thresholds = fewer false positives, but risk missing events.
- Always save at least one frame per event if all metrics fail.

### Real-time Constraints
- Ensure entire cycle ‚â§ 100‚Äì150 ms.
- Drop frames or skip metric computation under high load.

## Conclusion

A hybrid pipeline using fast, traditional metrics (confidence, blur, stability, lighting) for filtering, and BRISQUE/NIQE for final frame selection, balances performance with image quality.

With smart buffering, parallelism, and metric prioritization, the Raspberry Pi 5 can reliably capture the best possible frame of a fast-moving waste item without exceeding its computational limits.

This enables real-time, embedded image capture without compromising on clarity, making the system suitable for automated waste monitoring, dataset creation, or downstream analytics.
